## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

### Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based application where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. It aims to test and improve logical thinking by providing feedback after each guess. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number.

### Features
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a random number between 1 and 100 for the player to guess.
- **User Input**: Accepts guesses from the player through the console.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Informs the player if the guess is too high or too low, helping narrow down the answer.
- **Attempt Tracking**: Keeps count of the attempts the player takes to guess the correct number.
- **Replay Option**: Allows the player to start a new game after guessing the correct number.

## Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

### Description
The Student Grade Calculator is a Java application that accepts a student's scores and calculates their final grade based on predefined criteria. This task emphasizes input validation, calculations, and output display, providing practical experience in handling user inputs and displaying calculated results.

### Features
- **Subject Score Input**: Accepts scores for multiple subjects from the user.
- **Automated Grade Calculation**: Computes the final grade based on the entered scores.
- **Performance Feedback**: Displays grades alongside a Pass/Fail indication based on student performance.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that scores are valid (e.g., within acceptable ranges) before proceeding with calculations.
